# BookMark
An Android application developed as part of the ECM2425 Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing coursework.

## Introduction
### Purpose of Application
BookMark is an Android app designed for book lovers who often come across interesting books but aren’t ready to buy them just yet. Inspired by the experience of browsing a bookstore and discovering books to keep in mind, BookMark allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, preview details, and "mark" books they want to track for later.

### Functionality of Application
* Search for Books – Find books using keywords, powered by the Google Books API.

* Preview & Buy – View book details, preview them (if available), or access a purchase link.

* Mark Books – Save books you want to keep an eye on for later reference.

* View Marked Books – Access your saved books in the Marked Books section, with sorting options (by marking date, author, or publication date).

* Share with Others – Use Android’s built-in sharing options (Android Sharesheet) to send book details via your preferred apps.
